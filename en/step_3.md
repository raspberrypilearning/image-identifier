## Run the program

Now that you have the libraries you need installed, it's time to open the Python file you'll be using to do this project. If you've never written Python on your computer before, you may need to install a programmer's text editor first.

[WHICH ONE?]

Open your text editor and use it to open the `project.py` file in the directory you've been working in.

--- /task ---

There's a lot of code already provided for you, but it's all for creating the user interface of the application you'll be building. First, run the program as it is to get an idea of how the application will work.

--- task ---

Go back to your CLI window and type the following command to run the program. Remember it, as you'll need to run the program several times.

### If you're using Windows

```
python project.py
```

Then press the return key to run the program.

### If you're using a Mac or Linux
```
python3 project.py
```

Then press the return key to run the program.

It may take a moment, but when your program runs you should see something like the image below.

![The application screen. A title at the top reads 'Amazing Image Identifier'. The are below is divided vertically into two equal sections. On the left is a large red question mark on a white background. On the right is black text, also on a white background, which reads 'Please choose an image to identify.' At the bottom of the screen there is a 'Select picture' button, which is centred.](images/initial_application.png)

If you click on the 'Select picture' button, you will be able to select an image, which should replace the question mark. Note the image has to be a `.jpg` or `.jpeg` file, as this is what the model you'll be using will expect.

Once you've finished exploring the application as it is, close the application by closing its window.
