## Introduction

In this project, you'll create an application that will run on your computer. It will let you select a photograph of an everyday object, plant, or animal, and then provide some information about that thing. This could be used in a museum, to let visitors identify exhibits; could be combined with a model specially trained on a city to let visitors identify buildings and landmarks; or really any other situation where a person might look at something and ask "What is that?".

### What you will make

You'll use an existing image classification model that has been trained to recognise many things. You will combine it with information from Wikipedia to tell users about the things in their photographs.
